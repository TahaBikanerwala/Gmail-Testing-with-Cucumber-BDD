# Gmail-Testing-with-Cucumber-BDD
In this project, I have automated the compose feature of Gmail with different scenarios. I have integrated Maven, Selenium, and Cucumber in this project.

Since a dummy mail is used sometimes after entering email and password
* It asks for mobile number for verification
* That part is skipped in this code as it requires real mobile number and OTP
* In order to run this code kindly generate a new dummy mail and run the code
* Replace the email and password values in the excel sheet as the values are taken from there
* And you will be good to go
* Thank You!!
